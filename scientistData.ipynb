Similarly, the fact that several commentaries on the Aryabhatiya have come from Kerala has been used to suggest that it was Aryabhata's main place of life and activity; however, many commentaries have come from outside Kerala, and the Aryasiddhanta was completely unknown in Kerala.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatta#cite_note-sarma-9) K.
